这两天遇到了一个有点幼稚的烦恼，就是我突然发现喷喷的这个赛季会在月底结束，catalog上的积分会随之清零。
我浏览了一下catalog升级之后的奖励，发现85级的胜利结算姿势我很想要。但这就意味着在九天的时间里我要升十级。

接着我就陷入了苦恼，因为觉得这个任务非常艰巨。尤其是昨天晚上我连输了好多场，如果是按照平常的节奏，我早就应该收手了。
但是既然即使输了也能涨点分，所以我就硬着头皮继续打。但是越打越崩溃，感觉自己简直是蠢钝如猪，非常沮丧。

从前我在小红书上看到有人发帖说打喷喷带来很多负面情绪，我当时还鄙夷这些人至于吗，不就是打个游戏吗。没想到我也有这一天。

于是今天早晨我痛定思痛，做了一个简单的计算。再升十级需要95000分。在接下来的九天里，每天第一次取胜会有7500分的奖励，加起来就有67500分，所以我只需要再拿27500分就行了。
在这九天里有五天周末和四天工作日，如果周末打双倍的时间，那就相当于还有14天。平均下来，每天我只要拿2000分就够了！而即使是输一场，一般也有900分，赢了更是有1400分，所以我每天打三场就绝对够了，
根本就没必要像昨天那样逼自己一直打下去！

原来之前我完全是在夸大困难。一旦量化再分解一下，其实唾手可得。

吃午饭的时候跟朋友提起这个事，我说工作上其实也应该这么做。她说当然，但是工作上的事完全没办法量化。我说也对。唉

我想要的奖励就是这个胜利结算姿势（胜利结算这个说法好kpop)

Lately I’ve been dealing with a pretty childish problem: 
I suddenly realized that the current Splatoon season ends at the end of this month — and when it does, all the catalog points reset.

I was casually scrolling through the catalog rewards and saw that the victory pose at level 85 looks amazing. 
Which means… I have to climb 10 levels in just 9 days.

And that’s when the anxiety kicked in. It felt like an impossible mission.
Last night, I kept losing match after match. Normally I would’ve stopped long ago, but since you still get a few points even when you lose, 
I stubbornly kept playing.
Of course, the more I played, the worse I did. By the end, I just felt like a complete idiot — slow, clumsy, and frustrated.

I remember seeing people on Xiaohongshu complain about Splatoon giving them negative emotions, 
and I used to roll my eyes — “come on, it’s just a game.”
Well… turns out I’ve become one of those people.

So this morning, I decided to calm down and do some math.
To level up ten more times, I need about 95000 points.
In the next nine days, each “first win of the day” gives 7500 points — that’s already 67500 points right there.
Which means I only need 27500 more.

There are four weekdays and five weekend days left. If I count weekends as double time, that’s basically 14 days of playtime.
That means I only need about 2000 points per day!
Even if I lose, I usually get 900 points, and a win gives around 1400.
So if I just play three matches a day, I’m totally fine. No need to torture myself like last night.

Once I broke it down, I realized I’d been completely exaggerating the difficulty.
When you quantify and divide things into smaller chunks, everything suddenly feels doable.

I was telling a friend about this over lunch today and said, “honestly, this method should work for work, too.”
She said, “of course — but work tasks are impossible to quantify.”
And I was like… “yeah, fair point.” Sigh.
